Unfortunately, this was a slightly more difficult task than I anticipated. The default format for slides in Hugo appears to be Markdown slides, which is fine, except when your talk was made in Google Slides.\nGoogle Slides to Markdown? My first thought was that there must be some tool to convert a Google slides talk into a Markdown document. For whatever reason, there are several tools (like this GitHub repo) to go the other direction, from Markdown to Google slides. I found a GitHub repo gdocs2md that claimed to go in the other direction, but the script provided doesn’t currently run (if anyone is a whiz at Google Apps and wants to take a stab at fixing up this code, it would be a great tool!). There is a Google Drive add-on called GD2md-html that converts Google Docs to Markdown or HTML, which should be useful for the future, but it doesn’t help with Google Slides.\n Embedding Google Slides in Hugo Having abandoned the idea of just converting my current slides into Markdown and going on my merry way, I started looking for a way to embed the Google Slides themselves into my website.\nHugo shortcodes Hugo has certain snippets called shortcodes that are designed to address the problem of having to add raw HTML into Markdown. These shortcodes help render a content file according to a template created by Hugo. For example, the shortcode figure adds HTML functionality to the Markdown image syntax. There are shortcodes for Instagram (instagram), Vimeo (vimeo) and Twitter (tweet).\n The gdocs shortcode One of these shortcodes, gdocs, allows you to embed all Google doc types (Slides, Docs, Sheets, etc.) into your website. The HTML code for the shortcode can be found in the hugo-academic GitHub repo: https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/layouts/shortcodes/gdocs.html.\nI tried inserting the following into the index.md file for my talk below the line with three + signs:\n{{\u0026lt; gdocs \u0026quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTsSj-oftLksGEKTkzCoBSIpzooO61ZMGAUzoGBv7u20OzMQK8ctX3gCpWTMm4UowrrWumFrdQsY0Cd/embed?start=false\u0026amp;loop=false\u0026amp;delayms=5000\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} I got the URL by going to my Google Slides, and clicking File \u0026gt; Publish to the web. I selected Embed and copied the link following src=.\nUnfortunately, this didn’t result in anything showing up on my page besides a large blank space where I assume Hugo was trying to put my presentation. I tried some variations on the above code, including adding src= before the URL (no change), and moving the entire code snippet above the +++ line in index.md (results in the error \u0026quot; unmarshal failed: Near line 65 (last key parsed ‘image’): bare keys cannot contain ‘{’ “).\n HTML code At this point, I was feeling pretty discouraged, when I happened upon a Hugo forum post with the HTML code someone used to embed a Google Slides presentation. I have hardly any familiarity with HTML, but clearly shortcodes and I weren’t getting along very well, so I decided to give it a shot. I copied and pasted the code from the forum, replacing the URL following src= with my link from above, and voila! My slides appeared on the post.\nHere is the code for reference:\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTsSj-oftLksGEKTkzCoBSIpzooO61ZMGAUzoGBv7u20OzMQK8ctX3gCpWTMm4UowrrWumFrdQsY0Cd/embed?start=false\u0026amp;loop=false\u0026amp;delayms=5000\u0026quot; frameborder=\u0026quot;0\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;800\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;600\u0026quot; allowfullscreen=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; mozallowfullscreen=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; webkitallowfullscreen=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;   Moral of the story It seems like shortcodes can be a really valuable feature of Hugo, especially should I ever need to include a video of some kind (or if I actually start using Twitter again and tweet something worth sharing, two improbable events). In the case of Google Docs/Sheets/etc., however, just using the HTML code snippet seems like the easiest option (and is a good motivation to learn HTML at a later date).\n ","date":1544667194,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544667194,"objectID":"fcb45bed5417a023f0e46ff8490a4891","permalink":"/post/add-google-doc/","publishdate":"2018-12-12T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/add-google-doc/","section":"post","summary":"Given that the Academic website theme comes with a place to upload talks, I thought I might as well upload the slides for my Senior Honors presentation.

For example, I wasn’t loving that the first thing you saw when visiting the site was the giant picture of my face. I wanted to be able to put content at the top of the site and move information like my bio and work experience towards the bottom. Hugo allows you to weight certain types of content to change the order, so that’s what I tackled.\nMenu links The first order of things I could change was the order of links in the menu on the top right of my page. In this case, I wanted my information to be the first link, followed by “Publications”, “Projects”, “Posts”, “Tutorials”, and “Contact”. The weighting for these links is found in the config.toml file of the website repo, where a standard entry for one of the links looks a bit like this:\n[[menu.main]] name = \u0026quot;Publications\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;#publications\u0026quot; weight = 2 Here you can change the “name”, which is what the menu option actually says (e.g. I changed the menu option for my bio from “Home” to “About”). The URL refers to where on the site the link will point to. If you are trying to link to a homepage widget, as in the example above, the url will be # followed by the file name of that widget in the content/home/ folder. You want to be careful not to link to a widget that is inactive (which you can see in the first few lines of the Markdown document for that widget), otherwise the link will not go anywhere.\nIf you are linking to something else, you can provide the file-path relative to the content folder – for example, my tutorials live in the folder content/tutorial:\n[[menu.main]] name = \u0026quot;Tutorials\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;/tutorial/\u0026quot; weight = 5 Finally, you can change the weights to reflect the order you want the links to appear in the menu: the links will appear from left to right in ascending order of weight (weight = 1 is the first link, etc.)\n Home page content Initially, I confused changing the weights in the config.toml file with actually changing the order of those sections on the home page, but doing that actually requires editing the Markdown files for those types of content in the content/home/ folder. For example, I decided I wanted to put posts first, so I went to content/home/posts.md and modified the weight argument so that it was lowest and continued editing the weights until everything was in the order I wanted.\n ","date":1544580794,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544580794,"objectID":"a6892cf666663b12c2f001ba2287bc31","permalink":"/post/2018-12-11-order-items/","publishdate":"2018-12-11T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2018-12-11-order-items/","section":"post","summary":"As I continue setting up this site, one of the major things irking me was the order of content on the website.

I started out trying to create a GitHub site using Jekyll, since I knew I wanted my website to be hosted via GitHub to keep all of my code in the same place. After about an hour of unsuccessful commits that resulted in a lovely white page with my name on it, I scrapped the whole venture until I heard about the blogdown R package. Since R is my programming language of choice, the idea of being able to write posts in RMarkdown and preview my site from the comfort of RStudio was tremendously appealing. I saw a research site created through Hugo’s Academic theme using blogdown that referenced some helpful tutorials and decided to give the process another shot.\nHugo + blogdown After my initial failures with Jekyll, I knew enough about the process (and my own skills) to be wary of the Academic theme’s optimistic tagline “Create a beautifully simple site in under 10 minutes”. So fair warning: getting this site up and semi-running was the work of an afternoon plus. I am not going to provide a full tutorial here, since several excellent ones already exist, but I will give my input on which resources worked for me and where I had difficulties.\n  Useful resources I started out following Amber Thomas’s instructions for using blogdown, Hugo, and GitHub pages to create a website. I probably should have taken better note of her initial disclaimer that simpler methods of creating a site exist, but nonetheless I found her instructions useful for wrapping my head around the method behind the whole process. As she explains, GitHub pages and Hugo work in different ways: GitHub pages uses information from the master branch of the repository to build your website, while Hugo builds a website inside the public folder. The solution she presents in her tutorial creates a sub branch within GitHub. She provides some shell scripts written by Jente Hidskes that create the sub branch and also update the site. These did not run for me for whatever reason – I believe Hidskes has written an updated tutorial to fix them, however.\nWhile I was reading the comments on Thomas’s tutorials to try to troubleshoot the shell script problems, I found a different tutorial by Robert McDonnell that promised a more streamlined approach. McDonnell gets around the GitHub/Hugo conflicts by creating two GitHub repositories, one for the website (for example, my repo is called babichmorrowc.github.io) and one for all of the Hugo and blogdown content (mine is called website-hugo).\nTo link these two repositories, Thomas has users create a Git Submodule using the following code:\ngit submodule add -b master git@github.com:\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;.github.io.git public This is where, once again, I ran into difficulties. I kept getting the error:\nCloning into \u0026#39;\u0026lt;filepath\u0026gt;/website-hugo/public\u0026#39;... git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists. fatal: clone of \u0026#39;git@github.com:babichmorrowc/babichmorrowc.github.io.git\u0026#39; into submodule path \u0026#39;\u0026lt;filepath\u0026gt;/website-hugo/public\u0026#39; failed  Fortunately, there turned out to be an easy fix for this – the code McDonnell provides uses the SSH URL, which is something I do not have set up. I replaced it with the HTTPS URL (code below), and went on my merry way.\ngit submodule add -b master https://github.com/babichmorrowc/babichmorrowc.github.io.git public  Pushing to GitHub From that point forward, I had a functioning site that I could preview in RStudio using the serve_site() function. Using the following Git commands, I could push those changes and get that same site up and running online:\n# From the folder for the repo website-hugo cd public git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;new commit!\u0026quot; git push origin master cd .. git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;new commit part 2\u0026quot; git push  Editing my site I’m still learning my way around the format of the Hugo site, but by some trial and error I’ve started the process of customizing the site. I am using the Academic theme. So far I’ve managed to update my bio, add a publication, and take a stab at creating projects. As I get more familiarity with the format, I will try for a more comprehensive blog post explaining how to add your own content.\n ","date":1544235194,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544235194,"objectID":"54d7d81ed67058a3387b928edd138a51","permalink":"/post/2018-12-7-create-website/","publishdate":"2018-12-07T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2018-12-7-create-website/","section":"post","summary":"Getting started I’ve been contemplating the idea of creating a website for sometime, but my initial (mostly half-hearted) attempts ran into some serious technological glitches.

Eric Charnov presented three dimensionless metrics life history metrics that represent key life history trade-offs: lifetime reproductive effort (LRE), relative reproductive lifespan (RRL), and relative offspring size (ROS). These three metrics are theorized to be invariant with body mass, thus enabling comparisons of organisms across the body mass continuum. We use these metrics, in addition to body mass, to classify life history strategies across the four major classes of tetrapods: amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. First, we assess body mass invariance of LRE, RRL, and ROS in 113 amphibians, 491 reptiles, 843 mammals, and 171 birds. We find that, although the metrics are not consistently invariant across classes, all three exhibit qualities of invariance in at least one class and LRE and RRL display invariant behavior in the majority of tetrapod classes. Second, we investigate how the traits have evolved in concert with body mass, either to maintain or disrupt the patterns of invariance we observe. Finally, we compare the values of these metrics and their combinations across the four classes of tetrapods. LRE, RRL, and ROS delineate a space in which the major tetrapod clades occupy mostly unique subspaces. These distinctions in combinations of life history strategies provide us with a framework to understand the impact of major evolutionary transitions in energetics, physiology, and ecology.","tags":["life history","hypervolume"],"title":"Talk: Macroevolution of dimensionless life history metrics in tetrapods","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Cecina Babich Morrow","Drew Kerkhoff","Morgan Ernest"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504238400,"objectID":"d8b7bc75b9b20c60ef4e61e32564c0a5","permalink":"/talk/tree_2017/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/tree_2017/","section":"talk","summary":"**Objectives:** 1.

Estimating hypervolumes from sampled data has been an ongoing challenge due to conceptual and computational issues. We present new algorithms for delineating the boundaries and probability density within n‐dimensional hypervolumes. The methods produce smooth boundaries that can fit data either more loosely (Gaussian kernel density estimation) or more tightly (one‐classification via support vector machine). Further, the algorithms can accept abundance‐weighted data, and the resulting hypervolumes can be given a probabilistic interpretation and projected into geographic space. We demonstrate the properties of these methods on a large dataset that characterises the functional traits and geographic distribution of thousands of plants. The methods are available in version ≥2.0.7 of the hypervolume r package.

Previously, hypervolumes have been measured using a minimum convex hull, but convex hulls are exclusively determined by extreme points and they cannot account for possible holes in the trait space. A multivariate kernel density estimation method with hyperbox kernels was proposed to deal with high-dimensional or holey datasets, but this method produces unrealistically blocky hypervolumes. We examined two alternatives: a Gaussian kernel density estimation method and a support vector machine method. We tested these two new methods and the hyperbox method by creating hypervolumes for three New World biomes using trait data from plants and mammals. We varied the parameters for each method in order to determine sensitivity to parameter variation. The resulting hypervolumes were compared with respect to their total volume, shape, and overlap. The hyperbox hypervolumes consistently had the largest volume of the three methods. The Gaussian method proved least sensitive to variation in bandwidth, while the support vector machine is the most customizable in terms of its two parameters, but may be susceptible to overfitting.","tags":["plant biodiversity","BIEN","hypervolume"],"title":"Poster: Quantifying species tolerances and functional diversity using n-dimensional hypervolumes: a comparison of methods","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1469592000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1469592000,"objectID":"522d95df7835b342554012eb6e68d074","permalink":"/project/hypervolumes/","publishdate":"2016-07-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/hypervolumes/","section":"project","summary":"Testing new algorithms for creating *n*-dimensional hypervolumes.","tags":["hypervolume"],"title":"Hypervolume package testing","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is a \u0026ldquo;hello world\u0026rdquo; example website for the blogdown package.
