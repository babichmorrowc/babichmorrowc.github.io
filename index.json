Eric Charnov developed three dimensionless metrics to quantify fundamental life history trade-offs. Lifetime reproductive effort (LRE), relative reproductive lifespan (RRL), and relative offspring size (ROS), together with body mass, can be used classify life history strategies across the four major classes of tetrapods: amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. First, we investigate how the metrics have evolved in concert with body mass. In most cases, we find evidence for correlated evolution between body mass and the three metrics. Finally, we compare life history strategies across the four classes of tetrapods and find that LRE, RRL, and ROS delineate a space in which the major tetrapod clades occupy mostly unique subspaces. These distinct combinations of life history strategies provide us with a framework to understand the impact of major evolutionary transitions in energetics, physiology, and ecology.","tags":["hypervolume","life history"],"title":"PREPRINT: Macroevolution of dimensionless life history metrics in tetrapods","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":["R","phylogenetics","evolution"],"content":"   Inspiration for this post This post comes from the finishing touches I needed to put on a paper about life history evolution. The paper compares life history traits across the four groups of tetrapods (amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds), so when I carried out the nitty gritty phylogenetic analyses, I used four separate phylogenies. When it came time to make a figure to visualize those analyses, however, I ended up with an unwieldy (and unpublishable) 16-panel figure (four phylogenies by four traits). One of my coauthors suggested using a tetrapod supertree to visualize the evolution of the traits across all four classes simultaneously.\nUyeda et al. 2017 Uyeda et al. did something similar in their 2017 paper The evolution of energetic scaling across the vertebrate tree of life. They stitched together fish, amphibian, squamate, bird, and mammal phylogenies together to visualize metabolic rate across all vertebrates:\n  Figure 1 from Uyeda et al. 2017   At first, I was very hopeful that I would be able to download this supertree and prune it to the taxa in my analysis since the authors were using the same clade specific phylogenies that I was. The phylogeny is available on Data Dryad (https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.3c6d2). Unfortunately, after downloading that phylogeny and pruning it to include species I used in my analysis, I ended up with approximately 15% of the species I analyzed in the resulting tree.\n  Into the code Since my easy solution didn’t pan out and I couldn’t get enough information from the supplemental material for the paper to replicate their analyses, I looked on GitHub to try to find Uyeda’s code. Hooray for GitHub once again, because the repository for the paper can be found here: https://github.com/uyedaj/bmr. The RMarkdown details the analyses for the paper, including the process for making the full tree.\nStart with loading the necessary packages.\nlibrary(phytools) ## Loading required package: ape ## Loading required package: maps library(geiger) The original phylogenies I was working with four separate phylogenies: amphibians, squamates, birds, and mammals. For amphibians, I used a congruified time-tree from the PhyloOrchard package (O’Meara et al. 2013) that was constructed using the Alfaro et al. timetree of gnathostomes (Alfaro et al. 2009) as the reference and the Pyron and Wiens amphibian phylogeny as the target (Pyron and Wiens 2011).\nlength(amphibiantree$tip.label) ## [1] 2871 plot(amphibiantree, type = \u0026quot;fan\u0026quot;, show.tip.label = FALSE) For squamates, I used the Zheng and Wiens time-calibrated phylogeny (Zheng and Wiens 2016).\nlength(squamatetree$tip.label) ## [1] 378 plot(squamatetree, type = \u0026quot;fan\u0026quot;, show.tip.label = FALSE) For birds, I used the Jetz phylogeny (Jetz et al. 2012).\nlength(birdtree$tip.label) ## [1] 9993 plot(birdtree, type = \u0026quot;fan\u0026quot;, show.tip.label = FALSE) For mammals, I used the supertree from Fritz et al. 2009.\nlength(mammaltree$tip.label) ## [1] 5020 plot(mammaltree, type = \u0026quot;fan\u0026quot;, show.tip.label = FALSE)  Reading in trees The first step of the process is reading in the individual phylogenies you want to stitch together. This step is straightforward, with one exception: you cannot have species that are present in multiple of the individual trees. For example, my squamate phylogeny included Gallus gallus (red junglefowl) and Dromaius novaehollandia (emu). Since these species were also present in my bird phylogeny, I got the following error: Found matching tips in 'subtree' and 'phy'. To solve this problem, I just removed these tips from the squamate tree:\nsquamatetree \u0026lt;- drop.tip(phy = squamatetree, tip = c(\u0026quot;Gallus_gallus\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Dromaius_novaehollandiae\u0026quot;)) I ended up with the following list of trees and corresponding tip labels:\ntree_list \u0026lt;- list(amphib=amphibiantree, birds=birdtree, squam=squamatetree, mamm=mammaltree) class(tree_list) \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;multiPhylo\u0026quot;  Make a tree with orders In Uyeda et al. (2017), the authors were creating a phylogeny for all vertebrates, but for my analyses I was only examining tetrapods, so I didn’t have a fish phylogeny to include. The original code from Uyeda et al. to create a tree with the 5 vertebrate orders looks like this:\ntip.labels \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;fish\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;amphib\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;squam\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;birds\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mamm\u0026quot;) ## Make a tree with just orders: edge \u0026lt;- matrix(c(9, 4, 9, 3, 8, 5, 8, 9, 7, 8, 7, 2, 6, 7, 6, 1), byrow=TRUE, ncol=2) ## Dates from Timetree of life (timetree.org) edge.length \u0026lt;- c(274.9, 274.9, 324.5, 324.5-274.9, 382.9-324.5, 382.9, 454.6-382.9 , 454.6) Nnode \u0026lt;- 4 ordertree \u0026lt;- list(edge=edge, Nnode=Nnode, tip.label=tip.labels, edge.length=edge.length) class(ordertree) \u0026lt;- \u0026#39;phylo\u0026#39; plot(ordertree) To visualize the results, we can add tip labels, node labels, and edge labels to the tree with the branch lengths:\nplot(ordertree) tiplabels() nodelabels() edgelabels(ordertree$edge.length, bg=\u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, col=\u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, font=2) Getting rid of fish Since I didn’t have fish, I needed to make a few modifications. First, tip.labels didn’t need “fish” in it anymore:\n# remove \u0026quot;fish\u0026quot; from tip.labels: tip.labels \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;amphib\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;squam\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;birds\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mamm\u0026quot;) Now, for the trickier part - I needed to modify the edge matrix. The edge matrix contains the starting and ending nodes for each edge in a tree. As we can see from the plot above, numbering works in the following way: the tips are numbered starting at the top from 1 to the number of tips and the nodes are numbered starting at the root and moving towards the tips. To get rid of fish, I needed to delete one tip from the tree and one node (the original root node). I sketched out what I wanted the new order tree to look like, complete with numbered nodes and tips, and created the following edge matrix:\nedge \u0026lt;- matrix(c(7, 3, 7, 2, 6, 4, 6, 7, 5, 6, 5, 1), byrow=TRUE, ncol=2) Since I was losing two edges from the phylogeny (the one going from the root to fish and the one from the root to the last common ancestor of tetrapods), I also needed to modify the edge lengths by removing 454.6-382.9 and 454.6:\nedge.length \u0026lt;- c(274.9, 274.9, 324.5, 324.5-274.9, 382.9-324.5, 382.9) The final modification I needed was to decrease Nnode from 4 to 3:\nNnode \u0026lt;- 3 So now…\nordertree \u0026lt;- list(edge=edge, Nnode=Nnode, tip.label=tip.labels, edge.length=edge.length) class(ordertree) \u0026lt;- \u0026#39;phylo\u0026#39; plot(ordertree) edgelabels(ordertree$edge.length, bg=\u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, col=\u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, font=2) …I was ready to go with an order-level tree onto which I could graft my individual phylogenies!\n Node dates …Not so fast. I ended up with an additional problem I needed to solve before grafting the trees together. I ran into the error 'split_age' is inconsistent with edge lengths in 'phy', which means that the earliest node in one of my individual phylogenies was older than the node age I gave in edge.length. By using debug, I was able to tell that the error occurred when I added the squamate tree. The oldest node in my squamate tree was 277.8 million years ago, but I had set the divergence time between birds and squamates at 274.9 mya, so R was having problems. The species causing the problem was the tuatara, which is the only surviving member of its order.\n  The pesky (yet very cute) tuatara (https://www.australiangeographic.com.au/blogs/creatura-blog/2017/12/the-tuatara/)   I had a couple of choices: either delete the tuatara from the squamate phylogeny or increase the age of the last common ancestor of birds and squamates when I created the vector edge.length. I chose to do the latter because why get rid of such a cool animal!\nI went to http://timetree.org/ to see if I could find a reasonable range of estimates for this node. According to the website, which allows you to search for the divergence time between any two taxa, the estimated divergence of birds and squamates occurred 280 mya.\n  TimeTree results for divergence time of birds and squamates.   So I ended up with the following code and order tree:\ntip.labels \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;amphib\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;squam\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;birds\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mamm\u0026quot;) edge \u0026lt;- matrix(c(7, 3, 7, 2, 6, 4, 6, 7, 5, 6, 5, 1), byrow=TRUE, ncol=2) edge.length \u0026lt;- c(280, 280, 324.5, 324.5-274.9, 382.9-324.5, 382.9) Nnode \u0026lt;- 3 ordertree \u0026lt;- list(edge=edge, Nnode=Nnode, tip.label=tip.labels, edge.length=edge.length) class(ordertree) \u0026lt;- \u0026#39;phylo\u0026#39; plot(ordertree) edgelabels(ordertree$edge.length, bg=\u0026quot;black\u0026quot;, col=\u0026quot;white\u0026quot;, font=2) tree_list \u0026lt;- list(amphib=amphibiantree, birds=birdtree, squam=squamatetree, mamm=mammaltree) class(tree_list) \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;multiPhylo\u0026quot;   Grafting the trees The final step is grafting the individual trees onto the order tree in the proper place.\n#Add taxonomic information to tree otax \u0026lt;- data.frame(\u0026quot;Class\u0026quot;= ordertree$tip.label, \u0026quot;Superclass\u0026quot;=c(rep(\u0026quot;Tetrapoda\u0026quot;,2))) rownames(otax) \u0026lt;- ordertree$tip.label classtree \u0026lt;- nodelabel.phylo(ordertree, otax, ncores=1) res \u0026lt;- glomogram.phylo(classtree, tree_list) plot(res, type = \u0026quot;fan\u0026quot;, show.tip.label = FALSE) Voila - a tree with 18262 species of tetrapods!\n  Disclaimer I’d like to finish this post with a disclaimer: I am NOT a phylogeneticist (yet?). The supertree created in this analysis incorporates several different phylogenies from literature and adapts code from another published article (all written by people with much more phylogenetic background than I!). However, the accuracy of the tree decreases as you move back in time - there is a great deal of uncertainty about node age for the deeper nodes in the tree. Even so, this process allows us to make some cool visualizations to compare major clades across vast stretches of evolutionary time - even if precise dates are incorrect, overall patterns are still informative!\n Code The entire script I used for this process can be found at https://github.com/KerkhoffLab/bodymasspatterns/blob/master/tetrapod_phylogeny_code.R.\n Literature Cited Alfaro, M.

The package allows users to apply different masks to spcies distribution models to create more ecologically realistic range models. The package itself is very cool, but since it hasn’t been released yet, this post will be short on ecology. Instead, I’m going to focus on the process I’ve been using to debug the package. This debugging thought process and the different functions that make it possible are things I wish I’d been formally taught while learning R (but better late than never!).\ntraceback The traceback() function is definitely one of those that I wished I learned sooner. Basically, traceback() shows you the series of functions called, including the one resulting in the last error. For example, when I ran traceback() after the function I was testing threw an error, I got the following readout:\n  When I tried to use the function rangeSVM(), I got an error, as we can see in the first line of code I ran. By running traceback(), I can see the order of functions that rangeSVM() uses: first, it called the svm() function from the R package e1071, which in turn called svm.formula(), which finally called svm.default(). This last function, svm.default() is what produced the error (as we can see from the error message, as well).\nRunning traceback() can be especially helpful in situations like this, where the error message comes from a function called internally by the function you actually ran. Here, the error does not come from the rangeSVM() function, so reading the documentation for rangeSVM() could not save me. Now I know that the error actually comes from a function in the e1071 package, so I could check out the source code to figure out what kind of issue causes that error message.\n Checking source code There is a CRAN GitHub account that is an unofficial read-only mirror of all CRAN packages. Typically, when I want to read through the code for a particular function in a package, this is what I use. To dig a little deeper into what was going wrong with the svm() function, I found the code here. This allowed me to look at the function definitions for svm.formula() as well as svm.default().\n debug Reading through the source code is helpful, but wouldn’t it be even better if you could watch R step through the function line by line until the error? Fortunately the handy debug() function does exactly that. By running the following:\ndebug(rangeSVM) svmHYB_weight \u0026lt;- rangeSVM(variegatus[,2:3], tridactylus[,2:3], sdm = raster::stack(var_sdm, tri_sdm), nrep = 3, weight = TRUE) I could see that the error occurred at line 100 of svm.R:\n# Browse[2]\u0026gt; # debug at /Users/hellenfellows/OneDrive - AMNH/Wallace/maskRangerBetaTesting/maskRangeR/R/svm.R#100: m \u0026lt;- e1071::svm(sp ~ ., data = xy, gamma = params_best_df_mostFreq$gamma[1], # cost = params_best_df_mostFreq$cost[1], class.weights = cw) # Browse[2]\u0026gt; # Error in svm.default(x, y, scale = scale, ..., na.action = na.action) : # NA/NaN/Inf in foreign function call (arg 10) The Browse\u0026gt; prompt at the beginning of the lines indicate that the debugger is working. The debug at part shows the next line of code to be executed when you hit enter next. R will continue to show you the following line of code as you press enter (up until you hit the error). If you are running all of this in RStudio, it will also conveniently highlight the lines in the source code that will be run next. Also, when you want to get out of the debugger so you can run that function again later without debugging, run undebug(rangeSVM), for example.\nMy initial suspicion was that the function was failing during one of the runs of a for loop, however the debugger showed me that the function was making it through all the runs of the for loop. Instead, the error occurred during the final step of rangeSVM() when the function attempted to integrate the results of all runs of the for loop to create a final support vector machine model.\nget To figure out why this problem was occurring, I wanted to be able to see the values of the different variables passeed to that final step of the function. Handily enough, while in the debugger, you can use the function get(\u0026quot;variable\u0026quot;) to check the status of the different variables (the name of the variable needs to be in quotation marks).\nFor example:\ndebug(rangeSVM) svmHYB \u0026lt;- rangeSVM(variegatus[,2:3], tridactylus[,2:3], sdm = raster::stack(var_sdm, tri_sdm), nrep = 3) # Browse[2]\u0026gt; # debug at /Users/hellenfellows/OneDrive - AMNH/Wallace/maskRangerBetaTesting/maskRangeR/R/svm.R#96: params_best_df$params \u0026lt;- paste0(params_best_df$gamma, params_best_df$cost) # Browse[2]\u0026gt; get(\u0026quot;params_best_df\u0026quot;) # gamma cost class.weights # 38 0.5000000 2 1 # 85 0.0078125 2048 1 # 95 0.0078125 8192 1 This was the final step of the process that actually allowed me to figure out the problem:\n# Browse[2]\u0026gt; get(\u0026quot;params_best_df_mostFreq\u0026quot;) # [1] gamma cost # \u0026lt;0 rows\u0026gt; (or 0-length row.names) Without going into too much detail about the function itself, I was able to tell that the parameters I was feeding into the support vector machine function somehow didn’t exist: the variable params_best_df_mostFreq had 0 rows.\n  Other tips and tricks I got much of these resources from a very helpful blog post called “Tracking down errors in R” by Pete Werner (also available as a post on R-bloggers). This post goes through a slightly simpler example of debugging which is reproducible (something I have not attempted to do here), so it is very helpful for seeing the process on a simpler function. In addition to the techniques I used, Pete also explains how you can turn warning messages into errors in the case that your function is throwing a troubling warning message that you suspect is causing an error later on.\n ","date":1546567994,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546567994,"objectID":"91ff7b88c34bcad34a7aa89e491b6a42","permalink":"/post/debug-r/","publishdate":"2019-01-03T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/debug-r/","section":"post","summary":"PhD comics Jorge Cham (www.phdcomics.com)   Recently I’ve been part of beta testing a new R package.

Unfortunately, this was a slightly more difficult task than I anticipated. The default format for slides in Hugo appears to be Markdown slides, which is fine, except when your talk was made in Google Slides.\nGoogle Slides to Markdown? My first thought was that there must be some tool to convert a Google slides talk into a Markdown document. For whatever reason, there are several tools (like this GitHub repo) to go the other direction, from Markdown to Google slides. I found a GitHub repo gdocs2md that claimed to go in the other direction, but the script provided doesn’t currently run (if anyone is a whiz at Google Apps and wants to take a stab at fixing up this code, it would be a great tool!). There is a Google Drive add-on called GD2md-html that converts Google Docs to Markdown or HTML, which should be useful for the future, but it doesn’t help with Google Slides.\n Embedding Google Slides in Hugo Having abandoned the idea of just converting my current slides into Markdown and going on my merry way, I started looking for a way to embed the Google Slides themselves into my website.\nHugo shortcodes Hugo has certain snippets called shortcodes that are designed to address the problem of having to add raw HTML into Markdown. These shortcodes help render a content file according to a template created by Hugo. For example, the shortcode figure adds HTML functionality to the Markdown image syntax. There are shortcodes for Instagram (instagram), Vimeo (vimeo) and Twitter (tweet).\n The gdocs shortcode One of these shortcodes, gdocs, allows you to embed all Google doc types (Slides, Docs, Sheets, etc.) into your website. The HTML code for the shortcode can be found in the hugo-academic GitHub repo: https://github.com/gcushen/hugo-academic/blob/master/layouts/shortcodes/gdocs.html.\nI tried inserting the following into the index.md file for my talk below the line with three + signs:\n{{\u0026lt; gdocs \u0026quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTsSj-oftLksGEKTkzCoBSIpzooO61ZMGAUzoGBv7u20OzMQK8ctX3gCpWTMm4UowrrWumFrdQsY0Cd/embed?start=false\u0026amp;loop=false\u0026amp;delayms=5000\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} I got the URL by going to my Google Slides, and clicking File \u0026gt; Publish to the web. I selected Embed and copied the link following src=.\nUnfortunately, this didn’t result in anything showing up on my page besides a large blank space where I assume Hugo was trying to put my presentation. I tried some variations on the above code, including adding src= before the URL (no change), and moving the entire code snippet above the +++ line in index.md (results in the error \u0026quot; unmarshal failed: Near line 65 (last key parsed ‘image’): bare keys cannot contain ‘{’ “).\n HTML code At this point, I was feeling pretty discouraged, when I happened upon a Hugo forum post with the HTML code someone used to embed a Google Slides presentation. I have hardly any familiarity with HTML, but clearly shortcodes and I weren’t getting along very well, so I decided to give it a shot. I copied and pasted the code from the forum, replacing the URL following src= with my link from above, and voila! My slides appeared on the post.\nHere is the code for reference:\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;iframe src=\u0026quot;https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTsSj-oftLksGEKTkzCoBSIpzooO61ZMGAUzoGBv7u20OzMQK8ctX3gCpWTMm4UowrrWumFrdQsY0Cd/embed?start=false\u0026amp;loop=false\u0026amp;delayms=5000\u0026quot; frameborder=\u0026quot;0\u0026quot; width=\u0026quot;800\u0026quot; height=\u0026quot;600\u0026quot; allowfullscreen=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; mozallowfullscreen=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot; webkitallowfullscreen=\u0026quot;true\u0026quot;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/iframe\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt;   Moral of the story It seems like shortcodes can be a really valuable feature of Hugo, especially should I ever need to include a video of some kind (or if I actually start using Twitter again and tweet something worth sharing, two improbable events). In the case of Google Docs/Sheets/etc., however, just using the HTML code snippet seems like the easiest option (and is a good motivation to learn HTML at a later date).\n ","date":1544667194,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544667194,"objectID":"fcb45bed5417a023f0e46ff8490a4891","permalink":"/post/add-google-doc/","publishdate":"2018-12-12T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/add-google-doc/","section":"post","summary":"Given that the Academic website theme comes with a place to upload talks, I thought I might as well upload the slides for my Senior Honors presentation.

For example, I wasn’t loving that the first thing you saw when visiting the site was the giant picture of my face. I wanted to be able to put content at the top of the site and move information like my bio and work experience towards the bottom. Hugo allows you to weight certain types of content to change the order, so that’s what I tackled.\nMenu links The first order of things I could change was the order of links in the menu on the top right of my page. In this case, I wanted my information to be the first link, followed by “Publications”, “Projects”, “Posts”, “Tutorials”, and “Contact”. The weighting for these links is found in the config.toml file of the website repo, where a standard entry for one of the links looks a bit like this:\n[[menu.main]] name = \u0026quot;Publications\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;#publications\u0026quot; weight = 2 Here you can change the “name”, which is what the menu option actually says (e.g. I changed the menu option for my bio from “Home” to “About”). The URL refers to where on the site the link will point to. If you are trying to link to a homepage widget, as in the example above, the url will be # followed by the file name of that widget in the content/home/ folder. You want to be careful not to link to a widget that is inactive (which you can see in the first few lines of the Markdown document for that widget), otherwise the link will not go anywhere.\nIf you are linking to something else, you can provide the file-path relative to the content folder – for example, my tutorials live in the folder content/tutorial:\n[[menu.main]] name = \u0026quot;Tutorials\u0026quot; url = \u0026quot;/tutorial/\u0026quot; weight = 5 Finally, you can change the weights to reflect the order you want the links to appear in the menu: the links will appear from left to right in ascending order of weight (weight = 1 is the first link, etc.)\n Home page content Initially, I confused changing the weights in the config.toml file with actually changing the order of those sections on the home page, but doing that actually requires editing the Markdown files for those types of content in the content/home/ folder. For example, I decided I wanted to put posts first, so I went to content/home/posts.md and modified the weight argument so that it was lowest and continued editing the weights until everything was in the order I wanted.\n ","date":1544580794,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544580794,"objectID":"a6892cf666663b12c2f001ba2287bc31","permalink":"/post/2018-12-11-order-items/","publishdate":"2018-12-11T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2018-12-11-order-items/","section":"post","summary":"As I continue setting up this site, one of the major things irking me was the order of content on the website.

I started out trying to create a GitHub site using Jekyll, since I knew I wanted my website to be hosted via GitHub to keep all of my code in the same place. After about an hour of unsuccessful commits that resulted in a lovely white page with my name on it, I scrapped the whole venture until I heard about the blogdown R package. Since R is my programming language of choice, the idea of being able to write posts in RMarkdown and preview my site from the comfort of RStudio was tremendously appealing. I saw a research site created through Hugo’s Academic theme using blogdown that referenced some helpful tutorials and decided to give the process another shot.\nHugo + blogdown After my initial failures with Jekyll, I knew enough about the process (and my own skills) to be wary of the Academic theme’s optimistic tagline “Create a beautifully simple site in under 10 minutes”. So fair warning: getting this site up and semi-running was the work of an afternoon plus. I am not going to provide a full tutorial here, since several excellent ones already exist, but I will give my input on which resources worked for me and where I had difficulties.\n  Useful resources I started out following Amber Thomas’s instructions for using blogdown, Hugo, and GitHub pages to create a website. I probably should have taken better note of her initial disclaimer that simpler methods of creating a site exist, but nonetheless I found her instructions useful for wrapping my head around the method behind the whole process. As she explains, GitHub pages and Hugo work in different ways: GitHub pages uses information from the master branch of the repository to build your website, while Hugo builds a website inside the public folder. The solution she presents in her tutorial creates a sub branch within GitHub. She provides some shell scripts written by Jente Hidskes that create the sub branch and also update the site. These did not run for me for whatever reason – I believe Hidskes has written an updated tutorial to fix them, however.\nWhile I was reading the comments on Thomas’s tutorials to try to troubleshoot the shell script problems, I found a different tutorial by Robert McDonnell that promised a more streamlined approach. McDonnell gets around the GitHub/Hugo conflicts by creating two GitHub repositories, one for the website (for example, my repo is called babichmorrowc.github.io) and one for all of the Hugo and blogdown content (mine is called website-hugo).\nTo link these two repositories, Thomas has users create a Git Submodule using the following code:\ngit submodule add -b master git@github.com:\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;username\u0026gt;.github.io.git public This is where, once again, I ran into difficulties. I kept getting the error:\nCloning into \u0026#39;\u0026lt;filepath\u0026gt;/website-hugo/public\u0026#39;... git@github.com: Permission denied (publickey). fatal: Could not read from remote repository. Please make sure you have the correct access rights and the repository exists. fatal: clone of \u0026#39;git@github.com:babichmorrowc/babichmorrowc.github.io.git\u0026#39; into submodule path \u0026#39;\u0026lt;filepath\u0026gt;/website-hugo/public\u0026#39; failed  Fortunately, there turned out to be an easy fix for this – the code McDonnell provides uses the SSH URL, which is something I do not have set up. I replaced it with the HTTPS URL (code below), and went on my merry way.\ngit submodule add -b master https://github.com/babichmorrowc/babichmorrowc.github.io.git public  Pushing to GitHub From that point forward, I had a functioning site that I could preview in RStudio using the serve_site() function. Using the following Git commands, I could push those changes and get that same site up and running online:\n# From the folder for the repo website-hugo cd public git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;new commit!\u0026quot; git push origin master cd .. git add . git commit -m \u0026quot;new commit part 2\u0026quot; git push  Editing my site I’m still learning my way around the format of the Hugo site, but by some trial and error I’ve started the process of customizing the site. I am using the Academic theme. So far I’ve managed to update my bio, add a publication, and take a stab at creating projects. As I get more familiarity with the format, I will try for a more comprehensive blog post explaining how to add your own content.\n ","date":1544235194,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1544235194,"objectID":"54d7d81ed67058a3387b928edd138a51","permalink":"/post/2018-12-7-create-website/","publishdate":"2018-12-07T21:13:14-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2018-12-7-create-website/","section":"post","summary":"Getting started I’ve been contemplating the idea of creating a website for sometime, but my initial (mostly half-hearted) attempts ran into some serious technological glitches.

Eric Charnov presented three dimensionless metrics life history metrics that represent key life history trade-offs: lifetime reproductive effort (LRE), relative reproductive lifespan (RRL), and relative offspring size (ROS). These three metrics are theorized to be invariant with body mass, thus enabling comparisons of organisms across the body mass continuum. We use these metrics, in addition to body mass, to classify life history strategies across the four major classes of tetrapods: amphibians, reptiles, mammals, and birds. First, we assess body mass invariance of LRE, RRL, and ROS in 113 amphibians, 491 reptiles, 843 mammals, and 171 birds. We find that, although the metrics are not consistently invariant across classes, all three exhibit qualities of invariance in at least one class and LRE and RRL display invariant behavior in the majority of tetrapod classes. Second, we investigate how the traits have evolved in concert with body mass, either to maintain or disrupt the patterns of invariance we observe. Finally, we compare the values of these metrics and their combinations across the four classes of tetrapods. LRE, RRL, and ROS delineate a space in which the major tetrapod clades occupy mostly unique subspaces. These distinctions in combinations of life history strategies provide us with a framework to understand the impact of major evolutionary transitions in energetics, physiology, and ecology.","tags":["life history","hypervolume"],"title":"Talk: Macroevolution of dimensionless life history metrics in tetrapods","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Cecina Babich Morrow","Drew Kerkhoff","Morgan Ernest"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1504238400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1504238400,"objectID":"d8b7bc75b9b20c60ef4e61e32564c0a5","permalink":"/talk/tree_2017/","publishdate":"2017-09-01T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/talk/tree_2017/","section":"talk","summary":"**Objectives:** 1.

Estimating hypervolumes from sampled data has been an ongoing challenge due to conceptual and computational issues. We present new algorithms for delineating the boundaries and probability density within n‐dimensional hypervolumes. The methods produce smooth boundaries that can fit data either more loosely (Gaussian kernel density estimation) or more tightly (one‐classification via support vector machine). Further, the algorithms can accept abundance‐weighted data, and the resulting hypervolumes can be given a probabilistic interpretation and projected into geographic space. We demonstrate the properties of these methods on a large dataset that characterises the functional traits and geographic distribution of thousands of plants. The methods are available in version ≥2.0.7 of the hypervolume r package. These new algorithms provide: (i) a more robust approach for delineating the shape and density of n‐dimensional hypervolumes; (ii) more efficient performance on large and high‐dimensional datasets; and (iii) improved measures of functional diversity and environmental niche breadth.","tags":["hypervolume"],"title":"New approaches for delineating n‐dimensional hypervolumes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cecina Babich Morrow","Benjamin Blonder","Brian Maitner","Brian Enquist","Andrew Kerkhoff"],"categories":null,"content":"This poster was made using version 1.4.6 of the hypervolume R package.

Previously, hypervolumes have been measured using a minimum convex hull, but convex hulls are exclusively determined by extreme points and they cannot account for possible holes in the trait space. A multivariate kernel density estimation method with hyperbox kernels was proposed to deal with high-dimensional or holey datasets, but this method produces unrealistically blocky hypervolumes. We examined two alternatives: a Gaussian kernel density estimation method and a support vector machine method. We tested these two new methods and the hyperbox method by creating hypervolumes for three New World biomes using trait data from plants and mammals. We varied the parameters for each method in order to determine sensitivity to parameter variation. The resulting hypervolumes were compared with respect to their total volume, shape, and overlap. The hyperbox hypervolumes consistently had the largest volume of the three methods. The Gaussian method proved least sensitive to variation in bandwidth, while the support vector machine is the most customizable in terms of its two parameters, but may be susceptible to overfitting.","tags":["plant biodiversity","BIEN","hypervolume"],"title":"Poster: Quantifying species tolerances and functional diversity using n-dimensional hypervolumes: a comparison of methods","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1469592000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1469592000,"objectID":"522d95df7835b342554012eb6e68d074","permalink":"/project/hypervolumes/","publishdate":"2016-07-27T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/hypervolumes/","section":"project","summary":"Testing new algorithms for creating *n*-dimensional hypervolumes.","tags":["hypervolume"],"title":"Hypervolume package testing","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This is a \u0026ldquo;hello world\u0026rdquo; example website for the blogdown package.
