These decisions rely on the estimation of risk, which is modelled using information about hazard (the source of potential damage), exposure (the amount of damage experienced), and vulnerability (the level of susceptibility to damage), each of which has a high degree of uncertainty. We apply BDA to an idealised example application of adaptation options to combat the effects of heat-stress. Previous work has investigated the sensitivity of BDA to variations in hazard, exposure, and vulnerability. We build on these analyses to investigate how variations in the attributes of individual adaptation options, such as costs, affect the decision outcome. We perform uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to identify where the optimal decision is robust to variations in cost and to identify the most influential inputs and investigate how these vary spatially. We find a low degree of robustness in the optimal decision across most regions and an array of spatial patterns in sensitivity to the various financial cost attributes of the decision-making framework. Understanding which factors have the greatest influence on the optimal decision is crucial for transparent and robust climate adaptation decision-making.","tags":["BDA"],"title":"Bayesian Decision Analysis for climate decision-making: Sensitivity to decision attributes","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Cecina Babich Morrow"],"categories":null,"content":"\n","date":1701907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1701907200,"objectID":"e86bc1ba89204eb88aef5ef18b22b55b","permalink":"https://babichmorrowc.github.io/talk/bootcamp_2023/","publishdate":"2023-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/bootcamp_2023/","section":"talk","summary":"My presentation for the Bootcamp unit of the Compass PhD program.","tags":["BDA"],"title":"The Use of Utility: Utility functions in a Bayesian Decision Analysis framework","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1656892800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656892800,"objectID":"2dedbe62fa0b9511cac30b7a1f3c68f6","permalink":"https://babichmorrowc.github.io/project/mental_health_outcomes/","publishdate":"2022-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/mental_health_outcomes/","section":"project","summary":"Investigating mental health outcomes.","tags":["mental health"],"title":"Mental health outcomes","type":"project"},{"authors":["Julia Bondar","Cecina Babich Morrow","Ralitza Gueoruieva","Millard Brown","Matt Hawrilenko","John H.

Many practical applications need high-precision range estimates that are sufficiently reliable to use as input data in downstream applications. One solution has involved expert-generated maps that reflect on-the-ground field information and implicitly capture various processes that may limit a species’ geographic distribution. However, expert maps are often subjective and rarely reproducible. In contrast, species distribution models (SDMs) typically have finer resolution and are reproducible because of explicit links to data. Yet, SDMs can have higher uncertainty when data are sparse, which is an issue for most species. Also, SDMs often capture only a subset of the factors that determine species distributions (e.g., climate) and hence can require significant post-processing to better estimate species’ current realized distributions. Here, we demonstrate how expert knowledge, diverse data types, and SDMs can be used together in a transparent and reproducible modeling workflow. Specifically, we show how expert knowledge regarding species’ habitat use, elevation, biotic interactions, and environmental tolerances can be used to make and refine range estimates using SDMs and various data sources, including high-resolution remotely sensed products. This range-refinement approach is primed to use various data sources, including many with continuously improving spatial or temporal resolution. To facilitate such analyses, we compile a comprehensive suite of tools in a new R package, maskRangeR, and provide worked examples. These tools can facilitate a wide variety of basic and applied research that requires high-resolution maps of species’ current ranges, including quantifications of biodiversity and its change over time.","tags":["species distribution modeling","biogeography"],"title":"Operationalizing expert knowledge in species’ range estimates using diverse data types","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cecina Babich Morrow","S.K.

One example of biotic influences on geographic ranges is the common phenomenon of closely related parapatric species replacing each other across geography. We sought to address whether incorporating biotic information via post-processing SDM outputs would improve distributional estimates for three sloth species in the genus Bradypus with parapatric ranges. In a novel approach, we used support vector machines (SVMs) to spatially classify map cells, indicating which of the species is most likely to be present. We then use the SVM output to mask the SDM suitability predictions by removing pixels that the SVM indicated as part of the range of a different species. We implemented two different types of SVMs: 1) purely spatial SVMs, using only occurrence data, and 2) spatial + environmental SVMs, using occurrence data in conjunction with SDM-predicted suitability values. After using the SVM outputs as masks, we found that both SVM implementations were less likely to include occurrence points of congeners in species’ predicted distributions than the unmodified SDM predictions. Further, we found that the spatial + environmental SVM resulted in distributional delimitations for contact zones that best matched our ecological expectations for these species. This approach could be widely applied both to pure macroecological studies as well as conservation and management, including IUCN Red Listing.","tags":["species distribution modeling","Bradypus","biogeography"],"title":"Talk: Delineating parapatric ranges using species distribution models and support vector machines: An example with three-toed sloths (Bradypus)","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Cecina Babich Morrow","Peter J.

Estimating hypervolumes from sampled data has been an ongoing challenge due to conceptual and computational issues. We present new algorithms for delineating the boundaries and probability density within n‐dimensional hypervolumes. The methods produce smooth boundaries that can fit data either more loosely (Gaussian kernel density estimation) or more tightly (one‐classification via support vector machine). Further, the algorithms can accept abundance‐weighted data, and the resulting hypervolumes can be given a probabilistic interpretation and projected into geographic space. We demonstrate the properties of these methods on a large dataset that characterises the functional traits and geographic distribution of thousands of plants. The methods are available in version ≥2.0.7 of the hypervolume r package. These new algorithms provide: (i) a more robust approach for delineating the shape and density of n‐dimensional hypervolumes; (ii) more efficient performance on large and high‐dimensional datasets; and (iii) improved measures of functional diversity and environmental niche breadth.","tags":["hypervolume"],"title":"New approaches for delineating n‐dimensional hypervolumes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Cecina Babich Morrow","Benjamin Blonder","Brian Maitner","Brian Enquist","Andrew Kerkhoff"],"categories":null,"content":"This poster was made using version 1.4.6 of the hypervolume R package.

Previously, hypervolumes have been measured using a minimum convex hull, but convex hulls are exclusively determined by extreme points and they cannot account for possible holes in the trait space. A multivariate kernel density estimation method with hyperbox kernels was proposed to deal with high-dimensional or holey datasets, but this method produces unrealistically blocky hypervolumes. We examined two alternatives: a Gaussian kernel density estimation method and a support vector machine method. We tested these two new methods and the hyperbox method by creating hypervolumes for three New World biomes using trait data from plants and mammals. We varied the parameters for each method in order to determine sensitivity to parameter variation. The resulting hypervolumes were compared with respect to their total volume, shape, and overlap. The hyperbox hypervolumes consistently had the largest volume of the three methods.
