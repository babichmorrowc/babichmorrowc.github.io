Intensity of iron in a meteorite.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month I participated in the American Museum of Natural History’s annual hackathon (see my last &lt;a href=&#34;https://babichmorrowc.github.io/post/2019-02-14-hackathon/&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; for details about the event overall). During the hackathon, I worked with Katy Abbott, another Helen Fellow at the museum with me, to use a machine learning algorithm called DBSCAN to tackle our challenge. This post explains the process we used to complete the first step of the challenge: estimating the percent weights of elements in a meteorite.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;challenge-accepted&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Challenge accepted&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team, consisting of Peter Kang, Jackson Lee, Jeremy Neiman, John Underwood, Katy Abbott, Meret Götschel, and myself, chose to work on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/amnh/HackTheSolarSystem/wiki/Meteorite-Mineral-Mapping&#34;&gt;Meteorite Mineral Mapping challenge&lt;/a&gt;. For this challenge, our museum stakeholders, Marina Gemma and Sam Alpert, wanted a way to identify the mineral composition of meteorites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;pixels-to-percents&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Pixels to percents&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The scientists scan meteorites with an electron microprobe, a device that provides the intensity of x-rays emitted from certain elements. The electron microprobe results in images with grayscale intensities corresponding to these x-ray intensities on a pixel-by-pixel basis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;special-img-class&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34; src=&#34;/img/meteorite_pixel_intensity.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
Images of a meteorite produced by the electron microprobe showing pixel intensities for each of 10 elements - brighter grayscale values indicate greater amounts of that element in a pixel.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first step was to convert these pixel intensities to the percent weight of each element in the mineral at that pixel. To do that, we referred to a set of standard images taken of minerals with a known proportion of each element. For example, the image below shows the pixel intensities of iron in 8 minerals: you can see that the pixels are brightest in Fe, or pure iron, and lower in iron oxide (&lt;span class=&#34;math inline&#34;&gt;\(\text{Fe}_3\text{O}_4\)&lt;/span&gt;) and troilite, or iron sulfide (FeS).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;special-img-class&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34; src=&#34;/img/iron_standard.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
Standard scan of the intensity of iron in each of 8 known minerals.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can relate the intensity of the iron pixels in the Fe mineral, for example, to the percent weight in that mineral (100%, since iron is the only element in Fe).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;import-data&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Import data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We started by creating a .csv file with the percent weight of each element in the minderals from the standards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# import libraries
from sklearn.cluster import DBSCAN as dbscan
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn import metrics
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import matplotlib.colors
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from pathlib import Path
from skimage.io import imread, imshow
import numpy.ma as ma
from collections import Counter
# read in percent weights by element of the minerals in the standard
weights = pd.read_csv(&amp;quot;/Users/hellenfellows/Desktop/website-hugo/static/mineralmapping/weights_to_minerals.csv&amp;quot;)
print(weights.head())
##        mineral  Mg     Ni  Al        Fe      Ca  Cr   P        S      Ti  Si
## 0  CaTiO3std15 NaN    NaN NaN       NaN  29.481 NaN NaN      NaN  35.211 NaN
## 1  Fe-num2std9 NaN    NaN NaN  100.0000     NaN NaN NaN      NaN     NaN NaN
## 2      FeSstd2 NaN    NaN NaN   63.5252     NaN NaN NaN  36.4748     NaN NaN
## 3   Fe3O4std15 NaN    NaN NaN   72.3591     NaN NaN NaN      NaN     NaN NaN
## 4       Nistd9 NaN  100.0 NaN       NaN     NaN NaN NaN      NaN     NaN NaN&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Note: I was able to add the above Python chunk in R by following &lt;a href=&#34;https://babichmorrowc.github.io/post/2019-02-20-pythonrmd/&#34;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a linear relationship between pixel intensity and percent weight, so we used linear regression to find the slope of this relationship. We read in the .csv of pixel intensities for each element in the standards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# read in the pixel intensities by element in the standard
mineral_standards = pd.read_csv(&amp;#39;/Users/hellenfellows/Desktop/website-hugo/static/mineralmapping/mineral_standards.csv&amp;#39;)
print(mineral_standards.head())
##    Mg  Ni  Al  Fe   Ca  Cr  P  S   Ti  Si      mineral
## 0   0   0   0   0  171   0  4  0  459   0  CaTiO3std15
## 1   0   0   0   0  148   3  2  0  462   1  CaTiO3std15
## 2   0   2   0   0  141   6  3  0  455   2  CaTiO3std15
## 3   1   2   2   0  122   6  3  0  502   0  CaTiO3std15
## 4   0   0   0   0  138   5  5  0  457   1  CaTiO3std15&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We modified the chemical formulas of each mineral using a dictionary by separating each element in the mineral with an “_&amp;quot; to make looping easier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# create dictionary to standardize file names to chemical formulas
# needed to separate each element in the formula with an _ to make looping easier
mineral_dict = dict(zip(np.unique(mineral_standards[&amp;#39;mineral&amp;#39;]),
    [&amp;quot;Ca_Ti_O_3&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Fe_&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Fe_3O_4&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Fe_S_&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ni_S_&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ni_&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ca_Fe_Mg_Mn_Ni_Si_&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Ti_O_2&amp;quot;]))
# use dictionary to change mineral columns to underscore format
weights[&amp;#39;mineral&amp;#39;] = weights[&amp;#39;mineral&amp;#39;].map(mineral_dict)
mineral_standards[&amp;#39;mineral&amp;#39;] = mineral_standards[&amp;#39;mineral&amp;#39;].map(mineral_dict)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next we created a list of the elements accounted for in the standards and made an empty dataframe called &lt;code&gt;coefs&lt;/code&gt; to fill with the coefficients of the relationship between pixel intensity and percent weight for each element:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# list of elements
# need to ignore the &amp;quot;mineral&amp;quot; column of the data
elements = [val for val in mineral_standards.columns if val != &amp;#39;mineral&amp;#39;]
coefs = pd.DataFrame(index = [&amp;#39;coeff&amp;#39;], columns = elements)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;linear-regressions&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Linear regressions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we looped through the elements to create linear regressions of percent weight vs. pixel intensity based on the intensities in the standards. For these regressions, we forced the intercept to be zero because zero pixel intensity should imply zero percent weight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# make a linear regression forcing the intercept to be zero
# since zero intensity should correspond to zero percent weight
lr = LinearRegression(fit_intercept = False)
# loop through elements to create linear regression of percent weight vs pixel intensity
# in the minerals in the standard
for element in elements:
    element_df = mineral_standards[mineral_standards[&amp;#39;mineral&amp;#39;].str.contains(element + &amp;quot;_&amp;quot;)]
    # if the element has no percent weights, skip it
    if element_df.empty:
        continue
    minerals = element_df[&amp;#39;mineral&amp;#39;].unique()
    xis = np.empty(0)
    yis = np.empty(0)
    for mine in minerals:
        # get percent weights of the element in that mineral
        weight = weights[weights[&amp;#39;mineral&amp;#39;] == mine][element]
        intensities = element_df[element_df[&amp;#39;mineral&amp;#39;] == mine][element]
        xis = np.append(xis, np.array(intensities))
        yis = np.append(yis, np.repeat(weight, len(intensities)))
    xis, yis = xis.reshape(-1,1), yis.reshape(-1,1)
    # fit linear regression on percent weight vs intensity
    reg = lr.fit(xis,yis)
    xi_pred =  np.arange(0,900).reshape(-1,1)
    # create predictions for range of intensity values
    pred = reg.predict(xi_pred)
    reg.coef_
    # get the linear regression coefficient for each element
    coefs[element] = float(reg.coef_)
# print the coefficients for each element
print(coefs)
##              Mg        Ni   Al        Fe  ...    P         S        Ti        Si
## coeff  0.118599  0.328796  NaN  0.320081  ...  NaN  0.469225  0.077627  0.097906
## 
## [1 rows x 10 columns]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus &lt;code&gt;coefs&lt;/code&gt; contains the coeficient relating pixel intensity of an element to its percent weight in the mineral: for example, the percent weight of Mg in an mineral is equal to 0.118599 times its pixel intensity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;special-img-class&#34; style=&#34;width:100%&#34; src=&#34;/img/mineral_regression.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;
X-axes are pixel intensity and y-axes are percent weight of the element. Blue points indicate the pixel intensities of the element for a given percent weight based on a mineral in the standard. Orange points indicate the linear regression calculated above.
&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;calculate-percent-weights&#34; class=&#34;section level3&#34;&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Calculate percent weights&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, we used these coefficients to calculate the predicted percent weights of each element in the two meteorites we were analyzing on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The code for this portion of the analysis is available in the latter end of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/HackTheSolarSystem/MineralMapping/blob/master/backend/mineral_mapping_script.py&#34;&gt;this script&lt;/a&gt;. Note that for any pixel where the percent weight of an element was predicted to be higher than 100%, we set the percent weight to 100%. From these calculations, we ended up with the following files:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;pre class=&#34;python&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;# read file of predicted percent weights for meteorite 1
df_obj1 = pd.read_csv(&amp;#39;/Users/hellenfellows/Desktop/website-hugo/static/mineralmapping/predicted_percentweight_obj1.csv&amp;#39;)
df_obj1 = df_obj1.fillna(0)
df_obj1.drop(&amp;#39;Unnamed: 0&amp;#39;, axis = 1, inplace = True)
print(df_obj1.head())
# read file of predicted percent weights for meteorite 2

df_obj2 = df_obj2.fillna(0)
df_obj2.drop(&amp;#39;Unnamed: 0&amp;#39;, axis = 1, inplace = True)

## 
## [5 rows x 10 columns]&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Each row in these .csv files corresponds to a pixel in the original image. Each value gives the predicted percent weight of a given element in that pixel.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;up-next&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Up next&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we had converted pixel intensities to predicted percent weights, we were ready to use our clustering algorithm to identify potential minerals in the meteorite. Stay tuned for a future post showing how we used DBSCAN to accomplish this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img class=&#34;special-img-class&#34; style=&#34;width:40%&#34; src=&#34;/img/hackthesolarsystem.png&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last weekend I had the opportunity to participate in my first ever hackathon: the #HackTheSolarSystem hackathon hosted by the American Museum of Natural History.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;what-is-a-hackathon-anyways&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What is a hackathon, anyways?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a question I got asked countless times this last week as I informed my friends and family that I would be at work &lt;strong&gt;all&lt;/strong&gt; weekend (yes, including Friday night, yes, including Saturday night, no, I will not be able to socialize at all). And, in fairness, this is a question I wouldn’t have had an answer to prior to this job. A hackathon is an event where participants come together to use technology to address a challenge. Usually, the event takes place over a few days, where hackers form teams and collaborate on their projects, before presenting their solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I learned about this concept, I was baffled by the idea that it would be possible to come up with any kind of viable solution to a problem in only 24 hours. Coming from an academic background, I’m used to months of reading papers to get oriented to a problem before I can produce any kind of meaningful code. This event forced us to dive right in, looking at the problem from a computer science standpoint, rather than striving to get the full scientific background on the problem. I was amazed by the ability of all the teams at the event to create meaningful solutions to scientific problems they had not necessarily studied before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-ammh-hackathon&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The AMMH Hackathon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the past five years, the American Museum of Natural History has hosted a hackathon. #HackTheSolarSystem is the first and only hackathon I have participated in thus far, so I can’t compare it to other events, but my understanding is that the museum seeks to put on a slightly different type of event than other hackathons: AMNH wants to give technologists and scientists the opportunity to work together to create solutions to real research problems. For #HackTheSolarSystem, museum scientists from the Department of Earth and Planetary Science put forth a series of challenges they face in their research that they thought could be solved through technology. These challenges ranged from tracking dust particles through aerogel to visualizing the Sun (a full list of challenges is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/amnh/HackTheSolarSystem/wiki/Challenges&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). In addition to the scientific challenges, there were also educational challenges for both high school students and educators.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Friday night, the museum “stakeholders”, i.e. the scientists posing the challenges, presented their challenges and led participants on tours of various areas of the museum, like the Hall of Meteorites and the Earth and Planetary Sciences department. Then, from Saturday at 2:00 pm to Sunday at 1:00 pm, us hackers stayed at the museum to develop solutions to our chosen challenges. Most hackers worked on teams formed at the event, although some corporate teams came into the hackathon with a team already formed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div id=&#34;the-challenge&#34; class=&#34;section level2&#34;&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Challenge&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I chose to work on the meteorite mineral mapping challenge: our “stakeholders”, museum scientists Marina Gemma and Sam Alpert, wanted a way to identify mineral composition in images of meteorites. Each meteorite slice had been imaged, resulting in data consisting of pixel intensity for a handful of elements. We also had access to a series of standards with known mineral content so we could compare the pixel intensities in these known minerals with the pixel intensities in the unknown minerals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our team (pictured below) used four different approaches to address this problem: linear classification via SVM, random forest classification, nearest neighbor classification, and cluster inference. You can check out more details on these solutions in the Readme of our GitHub repository: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/HackTheSolarSystem/MineralMapping&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;https://github.com/HackTheSolarSystem/MineralMapping&lt;/a&gt;. (And I will post a more detailed explanation of the clustering solution in a later post, which is the part of the code I focused on!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our solution ended up making us one of the four primary winning teams at the hackathon! We won the “LabCoat Knockout” award for creating a solution with the potential to change the nature of research. We plan to continue working with our museum stakeholders to fine-tune our code so that it can be used in their research in the future. To me, that is the most exciting part of this event - that a group of technologists from diverse backgrounds (none of which knew much about meteorites before this event!) could write code in 24 hours with the potential to solve a scientific problem with a concrete impact on research at the museum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
